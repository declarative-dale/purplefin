# Purplefin

Purplefin is a custom Universal Blue image based on Bluefin:

```text
ghcr.io/ublue-os/bluefin:stable
```

The image is built from this repository and published to:

```text
ghcr.io/declarative-dale/purplefin
```

## Build-Time Composition

Purplefin's public build input is a named `BUILD_PROFILE`. Each profile is an
ordered list of reusable modules and exactly one hardware module. The primary
profiles are `base-generic`, `dale`, and `dale-cosmic`; Dale combines base,
sales, trainer, support, and Dell XPS 13 9350 Intel/IPU7 hardware, while
`dale-cosmic` adds Fedora's COSMIC desktop and makes it the default session.
Legacy `BUILD_ROLE` plus
hardware-valued `BUILD_PROFILE` inputs remain available for migration.

Reusable workload modules include `developer` (DevOps tooling plus Rust),
`sales` (Thunderbird), `support` (Espanso and RustConn), `trainer` (Grist
Firefox launcher), `executive` (Vates Notes Firefox launcher), and `it`
(RustDesk). The Framework hardware module is intentionally a no-tuning
scaffold until model-specific settings are validated.

Purplefin composes one department with one hardware profile and emits one final
bootc image. The common foundation is applied first, followed by the selected
department and hardware profile:

- `BUILD_ROLE` selects the department workload. Its historical name is retained
  for build compatibility.
- `BUILD_PROFILE` selects the hardware overlay. The historical variable name is
  retained for compatibility, but it now means hardware rather than the whole
  image personality.

## Graphical installer pilot

The optional Purplefin installer ISO uses Anaconda for storage, accounts, and
networking, then installs one verified, prebuilt bootc image. It does not layer
packages locally. After networking is configured, the Purplefin screen offers
the Base, Sales, and Support presets; on a detected Dell XPS 13 9350 it also
offers Dale. The selected GHCR tag is verified with the repository's GitHub
Actions cosign identity and resolved to an immutable digest before installation.
Unknown hardware safely receives a generic image.

The ISO is intentionally built on demand from the **Build Purplefin installer
ISO** workflow. See [installer/README.md](installer/README.md) for the source
selection interface and image-builder requirements.

| Department | Workload |
| --- | --- |
| `base` | Shared image foundation, including Git, Micro, and QEMU disk-image tooling. |
| `support` | Base plus the shared `devops` component, Espanso, and RustConn. |
| `development` | Base plus the shared `devops` component. |

| Reusable component | Workload | Referenced by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `devops` | Ghostty and its defaults, VSCodium, Ansible, Packer, OpenTofu, OpenBao, and their supporting configuration. | `support`, `development` |

| Hardware profile | Overlay |
| --- | --- |
| `generic-x86_64` | Generic x86-64 hardware with no vendor-specific overlay. |
| `desktop-x86_64` | Neutral generic x86-64 desktop scaffold for future hardware policy. |
| `lenovo-generic` | Neutral Lenovo scaffold for future hardware policy. |
| `dell-xps-9350-intel` | Dell XPS 13 9350 policies, lid-aware privilege authentication, rEFInd, and the IPU7 camera stack. |
| `dell-xps-9350-intel-no-ipu7` | Dell XPS 13 9350 test overlay with its non-camera and lid-aware authentication policies and pinned mainline kernel, but no IPU7 camera integration. |

Every hardware profile also applies the shared hardware-security baseline:
fingerprint authentication, PAM U2F/FIDO2 support, YubiKey management, and
smart-card services. User-specific fingerprint enrollments and security-key
mappings remain local to each machine and are never built into an image.
Both Dell profiles make `sudo` and polkit authentication lid-aware: an open lid
uses the normal fingerprint-first stack, while a closed or indeterminate lid
uses the local account password without attempting fingerprint authentication.

The default pair is the `base` department with `generic-x86_64` hardware. The
`generic-x86_64` and `latest` compatibility tags point to that same build. The
`dell-xps-9350-intel` compatibility tag points to the `support` department with
the Dell hardware profile. Departments and hardware profiles are independent
build inputs, but every published image contains exactly one of each; they are
not packages or layers selected by the installer. `bootc install`, `bootc
switch`, and subsequent upgrades track that single precomposed image tag.

The build workflow publishes these representative combinations:

| Department | Hardware | Image tags |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `base` | `generic-x86_64` | `generic-x86_64`, `latest`, and `base-generic-x86_64` |
| `support` | `dell-xps-9350-intel` | `dell-xps-9350-intel` and `support-dell-xps-9350-intel` |
| `support` | `lenovo-generic` | `support-lenovo-generic` |
| `development` | `desktop-x86_64` | `development-desktop-x86_64` |

## Build Locally

```bash
just build-generic
just build-dell
just build-dell-no-ipu7
just build-base-generic
just build-support-dell
just build-support-lenovo
just build-development-desktop
```

The first three recipes are compatibility entry points: generic builds
`base` + `generic-x86_64`, while both Dell recipes build `support` with the
corresponding Dell hardware profile. The remaining recipes name their
department and hardware combinations explicitly.

The `just` targets inspect Bluefin's `ostree.linux` label and write the matching
kernel label into the derived image. For an equivalent direct build, resolve
that value first:

```bash
base_kernel="$(skopeo inspect docker://ghcr.io/ublue-os/bluefin:stable | jq -er '.Labels["ostree.linux"]')"
target_kernel="$(build_files/select-ostree-linux.sh dell-xps-9350-intel "${base_kernel}")"
podman build \
  --build-arg BUILD_ROLE=support \
  --build-arg BUILD_PROFILE=dell-xps-9350-intel \
  --build-arg PURPLEFIN_OSTREE_LINUX="${target_kernel}" \
  --label "ostree.linux=${target_kernel}" \
  --tag ghcr.io/declarative-dale/purplefin:dell-xps-9350-intel \
  .
```

The Dell profile also accepts build-time kernel canary arguments:

```bash
podman build \
  --build-arg BUILD_ROLE=support \
  --build-arg BUILD_PROFILE=dell-xps-9350-intel \
  --build-arg PURPLEFIN_DELL_IPU7_KERNEL_EVR=7.1.2-355.vanilla.fc44 \
  --build-arg PURPLEFIN_OSTREE_LINUX=7.1.2-355.vanilla.fc44.x86_64 \
  --label ostree.linux=7.1.2-355.vanilla.fc44.x86_64 \
  --tag ghcr.io/declarative-dale/purplefin:dell-xps-9350-intel \
  .
```

The no-IPU7 Dell test profile uses the same pinned mainline kernel by default.
Its neutral canary arguments are
`PURPLEFIN_DELL_MAINLINE_KERNEL_EVR` and
`PURPLEFIN_DELL_MAINLINE_KERNEL_ALLOW_UNPINNED`.

## Switch To An Image

Select the complete department and hardware build you want. For example:

```bash
run0 bootc switch ghcr.io/declarative-dale/purplefin:generic-x86_64
run0 bootc switch ghcr.io/declarative-dale/purplefin:support-dell-xps-9350-intel
run0 bootc switch ghcr.io/declarative-dale/purplefin:development-desktop-x86_64
```

Reboot after switching. Switching changes the complete tracked image; bootc
does not combine a department tag with a separate hardware tag at installation
time.

The `latest` tag tracks the `base` + `generic-x86_64` image. The
`dell-xps-9350-intel` tag tracks `support` + Dell IPU7. The local
`build-dell-no-ipu7` compatibility recipe produces the `support` + Dell
no-camera test image. The full Dell camera profile uses the pinned
7.1.2 fallback only while Bluefin's kernel is older than 7.1.2, then follows
Bluefin's kernel. The reusable `devops` component provides Ghostty, VSCodium,
`packer`, `ansible`, `tofu`, and `bao`; both the support and development
departments reference it. The base department provides Git, Micro, `qemu-img`,
`qemu-tools`, and common QEMU image block backends.
Inherited Tailscale packages, services, repositories, setup hooks, and
user-facing tips are removed from every composition.
Terra's Bitwarden packages are excluded so future DNF operations cannot
reintroduce the desktop RPM after migration to Flatpak.

Bitwarden desktop is installed system-wide from Bitwarden's verified Flathub
package. A Purplefin timer checks it for updates twice daily, independently of
the bootc image lifecycle, and the image includes Bitwarden's polkit policy for
Linux system-authentication unlock. The native `/usr/bin/bw` CLI remains a
Purplefin-built RPM in the bootc image: its official versioned archive and
GitHub-published SHA-256 digest are pinned in `build_files/bitwarden-cli.env`.
A daily GitHub workflow checks for a new CLI release and opens a pull request;
merging that update builds the version into the next Purplefin deployment.

To request immediate update checks instead of waiting for the timers and
scheduled workflow, use:

```bash
run0 systemctl start purplefin-bitwarden-flatpak-update.service
bw update
run0 bootc upgrade
```

`bw update` reports whether the image-baked CLI is behind upstream; it does not
replace the binary. A merged automated CLI update and a subsequent bootc image
upgrade perform that replacement atomically.

### Migrating Bitwarden from the layered RPM

Purplefin images built before this change layer Bitwarden's desktop RPM on the
host during first boot. The replacement image preinstalls the verified Flatpak
and carries a one-time migration task that removes the old RPM layer without
deleting its per-user data.

Before upgrading, make sure the vault has completed a sync. Then deploy and
boot the updated image:

```bash
run0 bootc upgrade
run0 systemctl reboot
```

On the first boot into the updated image,
`purplefin-firstboot-rpm-ostree.service` detects the legacy `bitwarden` layer
and stages its removal. If a removal was staged, reboot once more:

```bash
systemctl status purplefin-firstboot-rpm-ostree.service
run0 systemctl reboot
```

The Flatpak uses `~/.var/app/com.bitwarden.desktop/` rather than the native
client's `~/.config/Bitwarden/` state. Launch the Flatpak and sign in again;
keep the old directory until the new client has synced and all expected vault
items are present. The native CLI keeps its existing configuration and remains
available as `/usr/bin/bw`.

Verify the completed migration with:

```bash
! rpm -q bitwarden
flatpak info --system com.bitwarden.desktop
rpm -q purplefin-bitwarden-cli
bw --version
systemctl status purplefin-bitwarden-flatpak-update.timer
test -f /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/com.bitwarden.Bitwarden.policy
```

If the one-time task did not remove the old layer, remove it explicitly and
reboot before launching the Flatpak:

```bash
run0 rpm-ostree uninstall bitwarden
run0 systemctl reboot
flatpak install --system flathub com.bitwarden.desktop
```

After migration, enable **Unlock with system authentication** in Bitwarden if
desired. A rollback to a pre-migration bootc deployment may temporarily expose
both desktop packages because Flatpak state persists outside the bootc image;
use the Flatpak, then upgrade forward again.

### Migrating from the Nextcloud AppImage

Purplefin images built before this change contain a Nextcloud AppImage in the
immutable `/usr` deployment. Deploy the updated image and reboot to remove the
AppImage, its `/usr/bin/nextcloud` link, desktop file, icon, and provenance file.
The shared Flatpak preinstall service installs the replacement automatically.
If it has not run yet, install the replacement explicitly:

```bash
flatpak install --system flathub com.nextcloud.desktopclient.nextcloud
```

Before rebooting, quit the old client with `pkill -x nextcloud` if it is still
running. After rebooting, verify the migration with:

```bash
test ! -e /usr/libexec/purplefin/appimages/Nextcloud.AppImage
test ! -e /usr/share/purplefin/nextcloud-appimage.provenance
flatpak info com.nextcloud.desktopclient.nextcloud
```

Nextcloud's Flatpak keeps application state in its sandbox, so launch it and
configure the account again if the existing AppImage settings are not imported.

## Dell XPS 13 9350 Hardware Policies

Both Dell profiles carry the non-camera policies below. Every hardware helper
checks for `Dell Inc.` / `XPS 13 9350` DMI data before changing anything.

### Lid-aware privilege authentication

At the start of each new `sudo` or polkit authentication, the Dell policy reads
systemd-logind's `LidClosed` property and cross-checks
`/proc/acpi/button/lid/*/state` when the Dell ACPI state is available. A
known-open lid uses the normal authselect-managed stack, including
fingerprint-first authentication. Any reported closed or conflicting state—or
the absence of an unambiguous open state—uses only the local Unix password.

Because `run0` and `pkexec` authenticate through polkit, the same behavior
applies to them and to graphical polkit prompts. Login and screen-unlock PAM
services are unchanged. The lid is sampled when a new prompt begins; closing
the lid does not replace an authentication method in a prompt that is already
open, and cached sudo or polkit authorization may avoid a new prompt entirely.

Inspect the state and force a fresh sudo prompt with:

```bash
busctl get-property \
  org.freedesktop.login1 \
  /org/freedesktop/login1 \
  org.freedesktop.login1.Manager \
  LidClosed
cat /proc/acpi/button/lid/*/state
grep -H 'purplefin-dell-lid-auth' /etc/pam.d/{sudo,polkit-1}
sudo -k
sudo -v
```

### Battery charging

`purplefin-dell-xps-9350-battery.service` enables UPower's charge-threshold
policy, selects Dell's `Custom` charging mode, and verifies a 75-80% charging
window. This favors battery longevity over maximum unplugged runtime. The
DMI-specific hardware database entry also makes the same limits explicit to
UPower.

Override the policy in `/etc/purplefin/dell-xps-9350-battery.conf`:

```ini
ENABLED=true
START_THRESHOLD=75
END_THRESHOLD=80
```

`ENABLED=false` prevents the service from applying the policy; it does not
undo thresholds already stored by the firmware. Use Dell firmware settings or
UPower to select a different charging policy when opting out. Verify an applied
policy with:

```bash
run0 systemctl restart purplefin-dell-xps-9350-battery.service
upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0 | \
  rg 'charge-(start|end)-threshold|charge-threshold-enabled'
cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/{charge_types,charge_control_start_threshold,charge_control_end_threshold}
```

### Power profiles

GNOME and `powerprofilesctl` continue to use TuneD. Balanced mode retains
Bluefin's normal AC/battery behavior. Performance mode now maps to
`purplefin-dell-xps-9350-performance`, which inherits TuneD's balanced laptop
profile and changes only CPU energy preference, boost, and Dell's firmware
platform profile. It deliberately omits the server-oriented disk, VM, sysctl,
and `min_perf_pct=100` settings from `throughput-performance`.

```bash
powerprofilesctl set performance
tuned-adm active
cat /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/energy_performance_preference
```

### Internal display and ambient brightness

The graphical-session user service selects the built-in FHD+ panel's
`1920x1200@120.000+vrr` mode on AC and fixed `1920x1200@60.000` mode on battery. It
discovers the exact advertised mode, preserves scale, transform, position, and
primary state, and refuses to act whenever an external connector or a complex
layout is present. A one-time migration enables GNOME ambient brightness; any
later choice made in GNOME Settings remains authoritative.

Copy `/usr/share/purplefin/dell-xps-9350-panel.conf` to
`~/.config/purplefin/dell-xps-9350-panel.conf` to change the mode selectors,
poll interval, ambient-brightness migration, or `PANEL_POLICY_ENABLED`. Apply a
change with:

```bash
systemctl --user restart purplefin-dell-xps-9350-panel.service
gdctl show --modes --properties
```

Secure Boot is intentionally not enabled while the Linux 7.1 camera path uses
an unsigned external `intel_cvs` module. Follow the gated
[Dell XPS 13 9350 Secure Boot runbook](docs/dell-xps-9350-secure-boot.md) only
after Purplefin has selected the signed in-tree CVS provider.

## Dell IPU7 Camera Flow

The Dell XPS 9350 Intel profile targets the Lunar Lake IPU7 (`8086:645d`),
Intel CVS (`INTC10DE`), and OV02C10 (`OVTI02C1`) camera in this laptop. The
generic and `dell-xps-9350-intel-no-ipu7` profiles do not install its module,
activation rules, or camera-specific userspace configuration.

IPU7 setup requires stable Linux 7.1.2 or newer; release candidates and older
kernels are rejected. At image-build time Purplefin reads Bluefin's inherited
`kernel-core` package. If its upstream version is older than 7.1.2, Purplefin
replaces it with the pinned EVR `7.1.2-355.vanilla.fc44`. As soon as Bluefin
ships 7.1.2 or newer, Purplefin keeps Bluefin's exact kernel instead. The same
decision is written to `/usr/share/purplefin/dell-ipu7/kernel-selection`, and
the build sets the OCI `ostree.linux` label to that exact release. Explicit
canary overrides remain available through `PURPLEFIN_DELL_IPU7_KERNEL_EVR` and
`PURPLEFIN_DELL_IPU7_KERNEL_ALLOW_UNPINNED`; exact EVRs can be blocked in
`/usr/share/purplefin/dell-ipu7/kernel-evr.denylist`.

Linux 7.1 has the in-tree IPU7 ISYS, USBIO, and OV02C10 drivers but not the
Lunar Lake CVS ownership fix. Purplefin therefore builds only `intel_cvs` from
Intel's `vision-drivers` commit
`845d6f8bdf66ff1f455901da9de5e00a53a83dce` (tag `26WW19.4_NVL`). That commit
guards the protocol-2-only host identifier command and works with the
protocol-1 CVS in this laptop. The module is compiled into the image against
the exact selected 7.1.x kernel; it is not built with DKMS after boot because the
Atomic host mounts `/usr/src` and `/usr/lib/modules` read-only.

The flow is:

1. The Dell profile keeps Bluefin's kernel when it is at least 7.1.2. Otherwise
   it temporarily enables the Dell-only mainline repo, installs the exact
   pinned 7.1.2 fallback, prunes the obsolete inherited module tree, and removes
   the temporary repo. Both paths validate the OV02C10, IPU7, and USBIO config.
2. The build accepts Fedora's compressed `ipu7_fw.bin.xz`/`.zst` firmware,
   temporarily installs exact matching `kernel-devel` when required, compiles the pinned Intel CVS
   module, verifies its kernel vermagic and `INTC10DE` alias, installs it under
   the target kernel's module tree, runs `depmod`, and removes build-only
   packages.
3. Fedora's stock `libcamera`, `libcamera-ipa`, `libcamera-tools`, and
   `pipewire-plugin-libcamera` provide the Simple pipeline and GPU SoftISP.
   No PSYS module, custom OV08X40 pipeline, `/usr/local` libcamera,
   v4l2loopback device, or proprietary camera HAL is installed.
4. At boot, `intel_cvs` performs the camera-ownership handshake. A udev rule
   and `purplefin-dell-ipu7-camera.service` then rebind `i2c-OVTI02C1:00` to
   `ov02c10`, covering the early-probe race documented in Fedora bug 2413472.
5. WirePlumber suppresses the 32 raw V4L2 devices whose description is `ipu7`.
   Those are ISYS capture endpoints, not webcams. The libcamera monitor remains
   enabled and publishes the single usable camera. A user service configures
   each Flathub Firefox profile to use its PipeWire camera backend, preventing
   Firefox from bypassing WirePlumber and enumerating the raw V4L2 nodes.
6. On Linux 7.2 or newer, the build instead requires
   `CONFIG_VIDEO_INTEL_CVS` and the in-tree `intel_cvs` module with the Dell
   `INTC10DE` alias, and does not build or install the external module.

This workaround is based on the same-hardware Fedora report at
`https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2413472`. Native CVS/IPU bridge
support first appears in Linux 7.2, which is the automatic handoff point for
the in-tree CVS provider. The external 7.1.x module is unsigned, so Secure Boot
must remain disabled on that path unless a locally enrolled module-signing key
is added.

Runtime verification on the Dell laptop:

```bash
uname -r
cat /usr/share/purplefin/dell-ipu7/kernel-selection
modinfo -n intel_cvs
readlink -f /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-INTC10DE:00/driver
readlink -f /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-OVTI02C1:00/driver
journalctl -k -b | grep -Ei 'ipu7|intel.cvs|ov02c10|firmware'
cam -l
rg 'media.webrtc.camera.allow-pipewire' \
  ~/.var/app/org.mozilla.firefox/config/mozilla/firefox/*/user.js
```

`cam -l` should report one OV02C10 camera. After restarting WirePlumber, its
graph should contain no raw V4L2 devices described as `ipu7` and one libcamera
camera source. After Firefox has created a profile, log out and back in (or run
`systemctl --user start purplefin-firefox-pipewire-camera.service`) and restart
Firefox. Firefox should then show one internal camera instead of dozens of
non-working IPU7 inputs.

## What Is Tracked

- Common foundation → department → hardware composition with the selected
  department and hardware written into image metadata.
- A shared base containing Git, Micro, Fedora's FUSE 2 runtime,
  `wireguard-tools`, the NetworkManager connection editor, `qemu-img`,
  `qemu-tools`, common QEMU image block backends, the complete Homebrew
  `Brewfile`, branding, and common Flatpak preinstalls such as Bitwarden,
  Nextcloud Desktop Client, Cameractrls, and Gear Lever. Fedora's `qemu-img`
  package supplies the core image tools; Fedora has no separate
  `qemu-img-core` subpackage.
- Bitwarden's verified desktop Flatpak, update timer, polkit policy, legacy RPM
  migration, and official native CLI wrapped in a Purplefin-built RPM from a
  pinned archive and SHA-256 digest.
- A centralized first-boot rpm-ostree runner with ordered tasks and
  `/var/lib/purplefin/firstboot/*.done` markers. It stops when a task stages a
  deployment so later tasks run after the required reboot.
- The reusable `devops` component's Ghostty defaults, VSCodium Flatpak,
  Ansible, Packer, OpenTofu, OpenBao, HashiCorp repository, and OpenBao
  state-directory policy; both support and development reference it.
- The support department's graphical-session-bound Espanso service and
  capability and RustConn Flatpak, in addition to the shared `devops`
  component.
- Removal of inherited Tailscale packages, enabled services, RPM repository
  configuration, setup hooks, and user-facing tips from every composition.
- Dell XPS 9350 Intel conditional 7.1.2 fallback until Bluefin reaches that version, exact kernel OCI metadata, external CVS for 7.1.x, validated in-tree CVS for 7.2+, OV02C10 reprobe compatibility, stock Fedora libcamera integration, and WirePlumber filtering for raw IPU7 endpoints.
- Dell XPS 9350 Intel lid-aware password/fingerprint routing for sudo and
  polkit, DMI-gated 75-80% UPower/Dell Custom charging, a laptop-safe TuneD
  Performance profile, AC/battery internal-panel refresh policy, and one-time
  user-overridable ambient-brightness enablement.
- A shared hardware-security baseline for every hardware profile, including
  fingerprint authentication, PAM U2F/FIDO2, YubiKey management, and smart-card
  services.
- Dell XPS 9350 Intel rEFInd Regular Dark theme staging plus an idempotent boot-time installer that enables it when `/boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf` is present.
- User-specific PAM U2F key mappings are not included. After switching, create
  the configuration directory and register a key with
  `mkdir -p ~/.config/Yubico && pamu2fcfg > ~/.config/Yubico/u2f_keys`.

## What Is Not Tracked

This public repo intentionally excludes credentials, biometric enrollments,
SSH/GPG keys, machine identity, private dotfiles, and user-specific systemd
control files.
